It's like an obligation every month, I have to listen to some new music albums with the same purpose as the previous month, which is to expand my musical taste. Lately, I can also say that this activity is one of my ways to practice writing.

Slightly different from the previous month, this month I used the [Last.fm](https://last.fm) service to give me recommendations from the music I listened to.

Without further ado here are some of the music albums I listened to

## Empress Rising by Monolord (2014)

This album was recommended by [Last.fm](https://last.fm). What attracted me at first was the cover art of this album which I thought was unique. After listening to it, I was a little surprised because the music in this album is very much in line with my taste. It's probably my favourite album of the month.

**Favourite Song : Either Empress Rising or Audhumbia**

## Come My Fanatics... by Electric Wizard (1997)

Since I had previously listened to Electric Wizard's other album Dopethrone, I was curious as to what their previous album was like. It didn't disappoint and I think this album gave me another impression of Electric Wizard that I know. The songs on this album are not as heavy as the songs on the Dopethrone album even if I wasn't told that this album was from Electric Wizard I wouldn't know who made this album.

**Favourite Song : Doomantia**

## No Drum and Bass in the Jazz Room by Clever Girl (2010)

If you asked me which of all the Math Rock albums I've listened to is the best. I probably would answer this album. I don't know the exact reason but I think this album fits any mood and can be listened to anytime and anywhere. The only thing I don't like is that it's not long enough.

**Favourite Song : ohmygodiloveyoupleasedontleaveme**

## 0 by Ichiko Aoba (2013)

A lot of people's reviews that I read said that this album is perfect for those who love nature. It's very different from what I feel which is more towards horror. I don't know why I feel that way after listening to some of the songs. I don't think I hate nature.

Anyway, I'm very interested in the composition of the songs on this album which is very different from what I usually listen to.

**Favourite Song : I can't decide because I haven't listened to this album much.**

That was my music experience in the month of August. A lot of new favourites and unique things I found. For this month I don't know what I'll find I hope I can find albums with genres that are very different from what I usually listen to.
