Continuing what I did in June, in July I also did the same thing and found some interesting albums, unfortunately I didn't have much time to listen to the albums I found. Here are some of the albums I found

## 2001 (The Chronic II) by Dr. Dre (1999)

From June I really wanted to hear a rap or hip hop album. So I tried to listen to this album because it was recommended by many people, and after listening, I agree with people's recommendations. I don't know what else to say about this album, I highly recommend it.

**Favourite Song : Forgot About Dre**

## Black One by Sunn O))) (2005)

I actually like Doom Metal or Stoner Metal, but after listening to this album, for some reason I don't really like it. Maybe because this album is mixed with Black Metal which I don't like. but that doesn't mean I hate this album, there is a possibility that in the future I like Black Metal so maybe not this time.

**Favourite Song : None maybe in future update**

## Led Zeppelin IV by Led Zeppelin (1971)

Maybe this is the best selling album from Led Zeppelin. Unfortunately, for some reason I don't get the mood to listen to this album. I admit the music on this album is good it's just that I can't listen to this album while doing my daily activities.

**Favourite Song : Stairway To Heaven**

## Chaos A.D. by Sepultura (1993)

All I know about Sepultura is that they're a famous Metal band from Brazil and that's it. I never tried to listen to Sepultura until now, so when I listened to some of the songs on this album I was a little surprised because I had accidentally heard some of the songs before and didn't realize they were from them.

**Favourite Song : Refuse/Resist**

## Animals by This Town Needs Guns (2009)

I've also been into Post Rock, Math Rock and the like lately, so when I was recommended this album I was a little excited. This album is the first album from TTNG, if I listen to it based on playing technique, then I will be very amazed by this album. But if I'm told to find flaws, then I think some songs have more or less similar guitar compositions. I often think that I'm stuck in a loop because of these similar compositions.

**Favourite Song : Badger**
