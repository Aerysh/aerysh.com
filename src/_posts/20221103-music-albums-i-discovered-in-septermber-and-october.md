I don't know if I should apologize or not for my late posts because I myself don't know if anyone reads this blog of mine.

I also have my own reasons why my posts are late such as my busy schedule and also lately I've been unwell.

But those things didn't prevent me from finding some new albums although not as many as usual. Here are some of the ones I found.

## Chinese Football by Chinese Football (2015)

At first, I was just having fun when I listened to this album because the name of this album which after I searched was indeed a tribute to **American Football**. But from my frivolity, I found a very interesting album even though the song uses a language that I don't understand, it makes the song even more interesting.

**Favourite Song : 地球上最后一个EMO男孩**

## Epicus Doomicus Metallicus by Candlemass (1986)

I found this album when I was looking at votes on [r/metal](https://reddit.com/r/metal). At first I was surprised because the songs on this album were different from the Doom Metal I knew, but I forgot that this album was one of the albums during the development of this genre so it makes sense and also I just realized that this album is the beginning of the Epic Doom Metal genre.

**Favourite Song : Demons Gate**

## Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) by Wu-Tang Clan

I thought hip-hop/rap music in America had more or less the same style but this album I think is unique because they sampled a lot from Chinese martial arts movies and after I explored further it turns out that RZA is a big fan of that genre of movies.

**Favourite Song : C.R.E.A.M**
