For some time now, I've been trying to broaden my music tastes. For me, who is not very knowledgeable about music, choosing music albums or artists and also genres that I want to listen to is quite a challenge. But in the end, I managed to find it. There are no certain rules regarding the music albums I want to listen to and also I do not limit what year the music albums are released. Here are the music albums that I found to last month

## American Football by American Football (1999)

This album seems to be the most important Midwest Emo and Math Rock album of its time. What I get when I listen to all the songs in this album is that almost every song on this album has a comfy feeling even though the themes taken in some of the songs feel a little bit heavy.

**Favourite Song : Stay Home**

## The College Dropout by Kanye West (2004)

Kanye's debut album and the first one I listened to. I've listened to hip hop songs from other artists but I've never fully listened to hip hop album and this is my first experience. And honestly I wasn't dissapointed even though I don't have the same experience or backround as what is usually sung in hip hop songs. I enjoyed this album.

**Favourite Song : We Don't Care**

## My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West (2010)

Last month I really wanted to try listening to a lot of hip hop or rap songs but I didn't know the artists I wanted to listen to so I went back to Kanye. I honestly like this album more than The College Dropout even though the international reviews of both albums are more or less the same. I was surprised when I listened to a song called 'Power' which turned out to be a sample of King Crimson's '21st Century Schizoid Man' this one definitely my most favorite.

**Favourite Song : Power**

## Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles (1967)

Believe it or not I never heard that this album existed. Just imagine, The Beatles the most famous band in the world and I never heard this album smh my head. From my experience, the songs on this album have very different way of writing from other Beatles songs and I really like it.

**Favourite Song : Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds**

That's all the music album I listened to last month I don't know what genre I want to listen this month I will try to explore again next time.
